            <p>Hello there, internet surfer. My name is Tian Welgemoed and this is a basic website which tells you a bit about me.<br><br></p>
            <p>I have been enjoying programming since I was about 14. Initially, scratch caught my attention, so I went on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="ref">Codecademy</a> to 
                some real-world languages like JavaScript and Python a go. I graduated high school at <a href="https://www.onslow.school.nz/learning-teaching/learning-areas-1/technology" class="ref">Onslow College</a> where the Digital Technologies department 
                is really good for a high school. We were taught Python, how to make a website using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Upon that, we did a couple of short 
                courses to learn some really <i>basic</i> &nbspJQuery, Graphics development and extra SQL. At <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/" class="ref">Victoria University of Wellington</a>, I gradutated
				with a Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours, majoring in <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/degrees/engineering/overview" class="ref">Software Engineering</a> and a Specialisation in Artificial Intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides programming, I like to stay active and socialise. My friends and I like to go on trips to random places to have fun and relax. I used to play cricket, hockey, tennis, golf and softball, so I am always keen for a friendly (or competitive) 
                game of any kind. I built a gaming PC and mostly play a competitive FPS called Valorant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a Junior Software Engineer at Trade Me. I mostly code in C#, Python, and have started to use Terraform. Otherwise, I'm being exposed to all kinds
				of technologies like GCloud, AWS, Docker, and more.
