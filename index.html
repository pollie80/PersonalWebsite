            <p>Hello there, internet surfer. My name is Tian Welgemoed and this is a basic website which tells you a bit about me.<br><br></p>
            <p>I have been enjoying programming since I was about 14. Scratch caught my attention, so I went on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="ref">Codecademy</a> to 
                some real-world languages like JavaScript and Python a go. I graduated high school at <a href="https://www.onslow.school.nz/learning-teaching/learning-areas-1/technology" class="ref">Onslow College</a> where the Digital Technologies department 
                is really good for a high school. We were taught Python, how to make a website using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Upon that, we did a couple of short 
                courses to learn some really <i>basic</i> &nbspJQuery, Graphics development and extra SQL. At <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/" class="ref">Victoria University of Wellington</a>, I am currently 
                in the final year of <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/degrees/engineering/overview" class="ref">Software Engineering</a> and in second year I had a <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/students/study/progress/grades" class="ref">GPA</a> of 8 (letter grade A) for 2020. Thus far, we have mainly used Java, C and C++. We have also
                covered SQL, Git and used AWS for learning how to set up and use servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides programming, I like to stay active and socialise. My friends and I like to go on trips where we relax between trimesters. During trimesters,
                if we have time we go out to some pool or simply hang out. I used to play cricket, hockey, tennis, golf and softball, so I am always keen for a friendly (or competitive) 
                game of any kind. I recently built a gaming PC with my experienced friend and if I'm not out or busy with work, I play some games online. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked at Hell's Pizza in Khandallah for about 3 years as a customer service person, a driver and a cleaner. All at the same time. Fridays can be quite busy,
                so that's when I exercise my multitasking and organisational skills - while remaining patient and friendly to customers and work mates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a part-time "Software Engineer" at Trade Legion Ltd. I use ReactJS to work on web and mobile applications we have developed. We use a Kanban board to keep track of tasks
                and this job suits me perfectly because I can decide my hours as uni can be really busy.
